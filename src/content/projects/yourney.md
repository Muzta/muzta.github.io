Travel web application where users could explore new points of interests and itineraries and plan their trips. Additionally, clients (business owners) could sponsor itineraries their establishments were involved in. Building the app from scratch, both the Front-End and Back-End, presented a significant challenge, especially as we ventured into new technologies. We had weekly project demonstrations to showcase our progress to the entire class, defending our decisions. Unfortunately, after passing the subject (and being complimented for its UI), we ceased the app deployment. However, I can share a demo video of this <i>beautiful and memorable</i> experience with you.
