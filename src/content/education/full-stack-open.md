This course offers a comprehensive set of courses designed to introduce learners to the technologies and tools needed in modern JS-based web development. The main focus lies in building SPA with the MERN stack, using REST APIs. It also covers aspects such as testing (unit testing with Jest/React Testing Library and E2E testing with Cypress), configuration and environment management, and the use of databases, among other topics.

I've dedicated over 150 hours to studying the main modules covering the MERN stack. Currently, I'm progressing through the complementary courses.

What I like the most

<b>✓</b> It includes numerous <b>external resource</b> links, allowing you to go deeper into concepts or areas you have not understood or wish to explore further.
